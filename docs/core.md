# Core Team

Swordfish is built and maintained by volunteers with a desire to increase security amongst teams without adding unnecessary overhead for individuals.

## Areas of Need

There are several areas of expertise needed to make Swordfish successful.

* **JavaScript** - Most of the front application is written in JavaScript (well, CoffeeScript), built around [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and uses many other libraries.
* **Ruby** - The API is a relatively small Ruby on Rails application, tested with RSpec and Cucumber, with data persisted in MongoDB.
* **Design**
* **Cryptography** - The application uses AES to encrypt items, and then encrypts the item key with an RSA key for each user.
* **Security** - Strong cryptography is useless if there are simple exploits in other parts of the application.

## Responsibilities

* Review, discuss and merge [pull requests](https://github.com/github/swordfish/pulls)
* Offer feedback on [Issues](https://github.com/github/swordfish/issues) and [mailing list discussions](https://groups.google.com/group/swordfishapp)
* Be a decent human being
* Give a damn
