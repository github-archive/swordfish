# Swordfish [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bkeepers/swordfish.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bkeepers/swordfish)

Swordfish is an experiment in builidng a group-optimized password management app. It is not functional. See [Current Status below](#current-status).

## Current status

It is currently very alpha. Some very basic features are working, but it is buggy and there is no support for authenticating users. See the [Alpha milestone](https://github.com/bkeepers/swordfish/issues?milestone=1&state=open) to see what is left to do before I consider it usable for a single user. [Browse all the issues](https://github.com/bkeepers/swordfish/issues?milestone=) to see what features are planned.

## Is it secure?

Storing passwords on a server might seem like filling a lake in Alaska with honey and expecting to keep bears out. I don't think it's like that. Why?

Even if an attacker gets access to your server or database, all secure items are encrypted client side. The server has no idea what it is storing and no way of decrypting it.

All items stored in a vault are encrypted with a *vault key*, which is randomly generated on the client when the vault is created and encrypted (currently with [AES](http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/#AES) and a master password, eventually it will use [PKI](#12)). The encrypted vault key is stored on the server, but the password is not. No sensitive data is ever transmitted over the wire unless it is encrypted using secrets only available on the client.
