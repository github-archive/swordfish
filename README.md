# Swordfish [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/github/swordfish.png)](http://travis-ci.org/github/swordfish)

Swordfish is an experiment in building a group-optimized password management
app. It is currently very alpha.

to see what features are planned.

## Is it secure?

Storing passwords on a server might seem like filling a lake in Alaska with
honey and expecting to keep bears out. I don't think it's like that. Why?

Even if an attacker gets access to your server or database, all secure items are
encrypted client side. The server has no idea what it is storing and no way of
decrypting it.

When you sign up, a RSA public/private keypair is generated in your browser. All
sensitive data is encrypted with your private key, which is password-protected
and never transferred to the server. No sensitive data is ever transmitted over
the wire unless it is encrypted with secrets only available on the client.

## Working on Swordfish

Use the `bootstrap` script to get the environment set up.

    script/bootstrap

Now you will need to run the database migrations before you run the server.

    bundle exec rake db:migrate

Finally you can start the application.

    script/rails s

Running the tests requries PhatomJS. If you're on Mac OS X you can use homebrew
to install this for you.

    brew install phantomjs

If you hack on Swordfish and end up adding or editing features you will want to
run the tests.

    bundle exec rake
